#Variable declaration
name = "Ollie"
age = 14
height = 174
address = "170 Coutts Street"
phoneNum = "04 939 3050"
hasAllergy = False

# A summary of this information should be printed out to the screen
print (name)
print (age)
print (height)
print (address)
print (phoneNum)

# Clarifying the problem
#Decide on the name variable 
fullName = "Ollie Hunt"
firstName = "Ollie"
lastName = "Hunt"
title = "Mr"
# Define the height measurement
# Metres
height = 1.74
# define address
address = "170 coutts street"
# street number and names
# address requires only  
# Country not required
# No detail of allergy type
# Date to be displayed in context of a readable language

# Design a solution/ algorithm 
# The variables declared above are to be stored as data
# These variables are draft and should be decided on before finalized
# Data type of height to be stored as 'float'
# mainly beacuse of the discreet decimal points of this measurement


# Code the algorithm as a program

# Final Variables

# Documentation
# at this point it should be done ablove.
# Critical analysis of your work can be noted here. Iclude how you could done things differently. Especally comment on how you could present data to
# 1. another programmer
#The above variables are displayed in the debugging screen
# 2. a user trying to make sense of your data
#The data shows my height, age, address, Phone number and if I have an allergy. This data can be found be hitting CTRL+F5
